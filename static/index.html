        <h1>Arthur</h1>
        <p>Arthur is a Discord bot. He does some things. For now, this website exists mainly as a place to house the <a href="/tos.html">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for this lovely little bot.</p>
        <p>Some other links you might find interesting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arthur's description (with features, etc.) on the <a href="https://discord.bots.gg/bots/329085343800229889">OG Discord Bot List</a></li>
            <li>Arthur's listing on the newer, fancier <a href="https://top.gg/bot/329085343800229889">top.gg</a></li>
            <li>The <a href="https://discord.gg/HW7KYG9">support server</a> for Arthur
                <ul><li>Note: Feel free also to come say hi and chat. It's not just support. In fact, it's rarely support.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <a href="https://github.com/nikbrandt/Arthur">GitHub repository</a> with the source code for Arthur</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=329085343800229889&permissions=3468352&scope=bot">link to invite Arthur</a>, which may or may not have the correct permissions up to date</li>
            <li>The poor, unused <a href="https://trello.com/b/wt7ptHpC/arthur">Trello board</a> with all the "planned features and bug fixes" that will be "implemented soon".</li>
            <li>This website's <a href="https://github.com/nikbrandt/Arthur-Jank-Website">GitHub repository</a> — not sure why you'd want that, though</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a very brief history, Arthur started off by another name, Marvin. This was my first time trying programming, and after a few different programming languages, JavaScript (through Node, with Discord.js) stuck. I improved and thought it was time to restart from scratch, so I built Arthur. Since, he's grown to be a decently big bot, which I think is pretty cool. Arthur's birthday is July 2, 2017 if that interests you.</p>
        <p>Feel free to chat! I'm currently attending UCLA studying Computer Science & Engineering but happy to chat about whatever. You can find me in the above linked support server, or by directly messaging me at Gymno#4741. I have other contact methods, but you'll have to go scavenge for those :)</p>
        <p>That's all I've got!</p>
