        <h1>Arthur: Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><i>Return <a href="/">home</a> or read the <a href="/privacy.html">privacy policy</a></i></p>
        <p>So, funny enough, I'm not a big enough entity to have any huge legal worries. This section is here to tell you the limitations to using Arthur. Essentially, these are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to Arthur is provided free of charge. Have fun.</li>
            <li>If a user is determined to be misusing (spamming messages, attempting to hack into its host, or otherwise illegal conduct) Arthur, they may be banned permanently from using Arthur.</li>
            <li>Arthur is provided as-is, without any guarantee. There is no warranty for using Arthur. If you run into an issue, the development team may be able to help, but no guarantees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's about it. Arthur is owned, operated, and developed primarily by one college student. Most of the code base is from early high school. I don't have any malicious intent, and all of the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/nikbrandt/Arthur">GitHub</a>. I'm happy to chat if you have any concerns; you can find me on the server linked on the home page and I'll likely respond in under a day.</p>
