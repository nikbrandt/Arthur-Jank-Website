        <h1>Arthur: Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><i>Return <a href="/">home</a> or read the <a href="/tos.html">terms of service</a></i></p>
        <p>Any message sent via direct message to the Discord bot Arthur <u>is logged publicly</u> in Arthur's <a href="https://discord.gg/HW7KYG9">support server</a>, if it is not a command. This is a feature built in good fun; users can have conversations with developers about whatever they please. In the five years Arthur has been running, only once has private information been logged -- in this case, it was removed and the original user was notified.</p>
        <p><u>You shouldn't be sending private data to Discord bots regardless</u>, but if something is sent and you'd like it removed, please contact Nikolas Brandt (Gymno#4741 on Discord, also available in the support server previously linked) for quick removal of the message(s).</p>
        <p>Please note: although these direct messages are "logged" in the sense that they are retained in place and can be looked up, they are <i>only logged</i> to a channel (#message-logs in the support server) within Discord; nowhere else. As such, Arthur itself does not collect any personal user data. This means the messages may fall under Discord's privacy policy as well, but that should be a given since you're using Discord in the first place.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, Arthur does not collect any personal data. Basic command usage logs are kept and a database is retained to build basic functionality (toggling server/user settings, handling leveling, keeping polls alive after restarts, etc.), but <u>none of this functionality</u> uses personally identifiable information: only Discord snowflake IDs (strings of numbers that represent users, servers, messages, etc.) are stored. Message content, usernames, and more may be temporarily stored in RAM while Arthur is processing messages, but will never be retained.</p>
        <p>Further, echoing a <a href="https://samlav.in/privacy.html">friend's privacy policy</a>, Arthur is a passion project of mine with my only intent in mind being "create something cool!". I have no motivation to do anything malicious with your data, and I'm happy to have a conversation if you're concerned. Additionally, all of Arthur's code is open source, which should provide absolute transparency and assurance that I'm not doing anything with your data.</p>
        <p>If you're curious, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kbGlTbG-SDcO5AiN2mWbhJNr7AyOZi26n3Nt9duI95w/edit">the old TOS</a>, which was more of the privacy policy, explains in detail what data is stored. Again, none of it is personally identifiable.</p>
